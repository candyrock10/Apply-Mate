# ApplyMate (Full Featured MVP)

Load unpacked extension in Chrome (Developer mode).

Flow:
- Open LinkedIn Jobs search results page and make sure it is the active tab.
- Open ApplyMate popup -> Save profile -> Set filters -> Scan
- Select jobs and click Apply Selected to bulk-apply

Notes:
- Resume file uploads cannot be set programmatically; the extension will surface a manual upload instruction for such flows.
- Be cautious: automating LinkedIn UI may violate LinkedIn TOS.
- Test on a secondary account first.
